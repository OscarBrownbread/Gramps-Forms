Template file for Irish geneology forms to be used with the Forms Gramplet in Gramps geneology software.

Replaces the IE1911 and IE1901 censes templates in "form_gb.xml" to hopefully create "form_ie.xml"

Updates those censes forms and includes more forms (birth, marriage, and death)

Does not use default event types. This avoides data loss from previous entries:
Birth to "Birth Cert."
Marriage to "Marr. Cert."
Death to "Death Cert."

Irish language form fields not included yet.
