Template file for Irish geneology forms to be used with the Forms Gramplet in Gramps geneology software.

Replaces the IE1911 and IE1901 censes templates in "form_gb.xml" to hopefully create "form_ie.xml"

Note that codes IE1901 and IE1911 are also in form form_gb.xml. This update creates a seperate file for Ireland. I Update those censes forms and include more forms (birth, marriage, and death).

I also included Irish 1926 census, which will hopefully be released in 2026.

It does not use default event types. This avoides data loss from previous entries. In other words, this will create a new event called "Birth Cert.", etc.
Birth to "Birth Cert."
Marriage to "Marr. Cert."
Death to "Death Cert."
